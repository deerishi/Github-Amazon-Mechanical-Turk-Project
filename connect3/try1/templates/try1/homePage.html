<h1> Multi Label Classification of Github comments</h1>


</center>

<p>
Thanks for agreeing to take part in the project.

The project’s aim is to understand how conversations take place on the website Github.com.

<p>
<h3> Pre Requisite knowledge required before doing the task </h3>
<strong>
You should have at some  basic programming background in any language.
Ideally you should be aware what Github.com(https://github.com/) is. 
You should be aware what code segments are and should be able to recognize that a given line is a piece of code rather than a normal sentence.
</strong>
</p>



Github is like a social network for programmers. For example on Facebook or twitter , people post their pictures and other people comment on them. On Github people post their segments of code , and other people comment on
<ul>
<li>how good/bad 	the code is, 		</li>
<li>If the code 	does not work , people suggest ways on how to make it work</li>
</ul>



Here the data set we are dealing is from such interactions. People commenting on other people’s code.

Consider this , if you send a FRIEND REQUEST to someone on Facebook , the other person would have to ACCEPT it.
Github operates in a similar manner. Instead of friend requests, people send other people something called a PULL REQUEST (which is basically a couple of lines of code ) . On Facebook the friend request is accepted, on Github the Pull Request gets MERGED ( which means that other people have accepted the code you have written).

In all the sentences in this project, one person sends a piece of code (a.k.a. pull request ) in hopes of getting it merged (a.k.a accepted) . Other people comment on the piece of code explaining what needs to be done to improve the code in order to get it merged.

We would want you to label the sentences in the following 2 categories and remove any unnecessary lines of code in the sentence :

<div class="task1">
<h3><strong><u>Task 1:</u> </strong></h3>
<p>
First category consists of the following 12 subcategories . The words in the brackets in the bracket signifies type of behaviour portrayed in the sentence. You have to select at least 1 and a maximum of 3 sub categories for each sentence.
<ul>
<li> Shows Solidarity (help, compliment, gratify) </li>
<li> Shows tension release	(josh, laugh with, cheer)</li>
<li> Agrees (agree 	with, understand,accommodate )</li>
<li> Gives Suggestion (encourage, cue, coach)</li>
<li> Gives opinion (evaluate, analyze, entreat)</li>
<li> Gives orientation (inform, educate, explain)</li>
<li> Asks for orientation (quiz, question, ask about)	</li>
<li> Asks for opinion (consult, prompt, query)	</li>
<li> Asks for suggestion (entreat, ask, beseech)	</li>
<li> Disagrees 	(disagree with, ignore, hinder)</li>
<li> Shows Tension 	(fear, cajole, evade)</li>
<li> Shows Antagonism (argue with, deride, defy)</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="task2">
<h3><strong><u>Task 2:</u> </strong></h3>
<p>
The second category is the kind of emotion displayed by the person writing the comment. Again there are 10 different categories. You have to select at least 1 and a maximum of 3 emotions for each sentence.
<ul>	
<li>Thanks</li>
<li>Sorry</li>
<li>Calm </li>
<li>Nervous	</li>
<li>Careless </li>
<li>Cautious </li>
<li>Aggressive </li>
<li>Defensive</li>
<li>Happy</li>
<li>Angry</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="task3">
<h3><strong><u>Task 3:</u> </strong></h3>
<p>
Removing  unnecessary lines of code. In the website, the section where the sentence is displayed, you are allowed to modify the sentence. 
If you come across any unnecessary lines of code ( which can be identified as anything not written in english ), you can simple use the backspace key to erase those. 
<strong> A segment of code can be identified as a sequence of words that do not seem to be a valid english sentence. Such sequence of words should be erased by simply pressing the backspace key or by selecting that portion of text with a mouse and then pressing backspace key or delete key. Any line of the sentence that seem rather irrelevant to the classificaton of the sentence into the specified categories should be removed.</strong>

For example for the sentence 
<p><i> 	 	
Added test to ensure single class is passed. Multiple classes gave false positive.
e.g.
 &lt; div id="id" class="class class2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
$("#id").hasClass("class class2") => false
</i>
</p>

The latter part of the sentence is all code, you should erase that so that the sentence becomes 

<p><i>	 	 	
Added test to ensure single class is passed. Multiple classes gave false positive.
</i>
</p>

<div class="Instructions">
<h3><strong><u>Instructions on how to label a sentence.</u> </strong></h3>
<p>

You do not have to understand what exactly is going on in a sentence. Since , each comment can involve a lot of programming dependent terminology. The way to label the sentences is as follows :

Looks for a sequence of words would describe what the person did :
For example :

<p> <strong> Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>
<i>
fallback for wildcard since there is no support to remove all classes and another loop didn't seem to make sense... there is an issue with the wildcard (existing) where removeClass("*") gives invalid argument error.
</i>
</p>

The above sentence is a bit hard to label in the 2 categories. The way to proceed is to look for a sequence of words that describe what the person did or is trying to convey:
<p><i>
fallback for wildcard since there is no support to remove all classes and another loop didn't seem to make sense...<b> there is an issue with the</b> wildcard (existing) where removeClass("*") <b>gives invalid argument error.</b>
</i>
</p>

The bold part of the sentence, signifies that the person is trying to convey that there is some issue which gives a error.
Now based on this bolded part, you have to label in the 2 categories.

In the first category you could choose : <i>Disagrees , Shows antagonism</i>
For the emotion you could choose : <i>Aggressive</i>

</p>
<p> <strong> Example 2 </strong>
<p><i><b>I think you might need to</b> prefix the string with ^ like above, because of some other processing we do later on the chain with error messages.</i></p>

The first category could be :<i> Gives opinion</i>


The second category could be <i>Cautious , Defensive</i>
</p>

<p> <strong> Example 3 </strong>
<p><i><b>I'd like to keep the </b>YourKit stuff <b>out of the</b> oae module.
You can deliver a custom setenv.sh.erb template via the setenv_template param to oae::app::server 

If you add the YK java arguments to localconfig/templates/oae-setenv.sh.erb then the oae module</i></p>

The first category could be :<i> Gives orientation, Shows Antagnism,DisAgrees.</i>

The second category could be <i>Agressive , Defensive</i>
</p>

<p> <strong> Example 4 </strong>
<p><i><b>Yep, you are right,</b> the problem is that we don't know if more headers have been added.
<n>Another option is to </b>create a 'refresh' method and call it from outside every time a new header is created/removed.
<b>Makes sense for me.</b></i></p>

The first category could be :<i> Shows solidarity, Agrees, Gives suggestion</i>

The second category could be <i>Thanks, Calm</i>
</p>

<p> <strong> Example 5 </strong>
<p><i><b>good catch, thought i got everything.</b>

<p>Since the above comment has some unncessary code (and one not required line), you should simply remove it. So the sentence now becomes</p>
<p><i><b>good catch, thought i got everything.</b>

</i></p>
The first category could be :<i> Shows solidarity, Agrees</i>

The second category could be <i>Thanks</i>
</p>

<p> <strong> Example 6 </strong>
<p><i><b>I agree with Brad;</b> either the *complete* experience, or an unadorned page-refreshing experience. <b>I think a partially-working </b> automatic filter would be confusing. On 9 Aug 2012, at 17:02, Bradley Wright &lt;notifications@github.com&gt; wrote: &gt; In app/asse
